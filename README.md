NOTE: The majority of NodeCanvas is not needed. I needed a Blackboard system and it was already conveniently in the project so I went with it. Perhaps some day I'll re-implement my own Blackboard or reference another free alterantive. For now it's not a massive undertaking to abstract it out for anyone that doesn't have NodeCanvas.
